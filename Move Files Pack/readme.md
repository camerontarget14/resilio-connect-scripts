# Move files pack

This folder contains set of scripts which will clean up the source folder after files were delivered to destination. These scripts can only be used with transfer jobs (distribution and consolidation). The contents of the files below should be copied inside the "After all Agents complete downloading" trigger of your transfer jobs. 

Please DO NOT place these scripts in "After an Agent completes downloading"
